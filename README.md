# Machine-Learning-In-Data-Science-
## Project on Data Science using Python and Applying the Machine Learning Algorithms 

Overview: 
The objective of this Project is to scrape a corpus of news articles from a set of web pages, pre-process the corpus, and evaluate the performance of automated classification of these articles in a supervised learning context. The project has been implemented as a single IPython Notebook. The code has been clearly documented, using comments and Markdown cells to explain my code and results.

# Part 1. Data Collection 
  
 The goal here is to collect a labelled news corpus. Tasks to be completed: 
  1. Identify the URLs and category labels for all news articles listed on the website:                  http://mlg.ucd.ie/modules/COMP41680/archive/index.html 
  2. Retrieve all web pages corresponding to these News article URLs From the web pages, extract
  the main body text containing the content of each news article. Save the body of each article as plain text. 
  3. Save the category labels for all News articles in a separate file.
